### **Sentinel AI CyberDefense**
*An Intelligent Threat Detection and Response Framework*

**Overview:**  
Sentinel AI is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to detect, analyze, and respond to anomalous network activity using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Built for secure environments and federal simulation labs, the system leverages AI-driven pattern recognition to identify spam, phishing attempts, and unusual user behavior across virtualized infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses NLP techniques to flag textual anomalies and spam indicators in email headers, metadata, and logs  
- 📊 **Behavioral Analytics Engine**: Tracks endpoint and network behavior deviations using ML-based profiling  
- 🧪 **Virtual Lab Compatibility**: Configured to run within GNS3/VMware test beds for secure simulation and forensic evaluation  
- 🔄 **Automated Alerts & Response**: Generates risk scores and triggers configurable alerts with optional system quarantine or access restrictions  
- 📁 **Modular Architecture**: Supports integration with Splunk, Cisco ASA logs, and future threat intelligence feeds

**Built With:**  
`Python 3.x`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NLTK`, `VMware`, `Cisco ACS`, `SolarWinds`, `GNS3`

**Use Cases:**  
- Simulation of malware/anomaly detection in mission-critical network topologies  
- Educational tool for cybersecurity mentoring programs  
- Prototype for scalable AI-enabled intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
